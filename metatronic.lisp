of anonymous variables and the sharing table.

Arguments are FORM with keyword arguments
- REWRITES is a table of variables returned from a previous call
- SHARES is a sharing table returned from a previous call
- REWRITER, if given, should be a designator for a function of one
  argument, a symbol, which should either return the symbol or a
  metatronized symbol and an indication of whether it should be stored
  in the rewrite table.

This only looks at list structure.  Sharing and circularity of list
structure (only) is correctly copied."
